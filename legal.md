## Disclaimer

The content of this website has been painstakingly compiled. However, we make no representation or guarantee regarding the accuracy, completeness or currency of the information on this website. Being a service provider, under Section 7(1) TMG (German Teleservices Act) we are liable for our own content on this website in accordance with general legislation. Pursuant to Sections 8–10 TMG, however, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor information from third parties that is transmitted to or held by us, or to search for evidence of illegal activity. This has no effect on the obligations under general legislation to remove or prevent the use of information. However, liability in this connection can only be accepted from the time at which a specific violation of the law becomes known to us. On becoming aware of any such legal infringements, we will remove the content concerned without delay.

## Liability for links

Our website contains links to external websites belonging to third-party providers over whose content we have no control. We are therefore unable to accept any liability for the content of linked websites; instead, liability for them is borne by their respective providers or operators. The linked sites were checked for any legal infringements when each link was created and none were found. However, we cannot be reasonably expected to continuously monitor linked websites for illegal content without specific evidence thereof. On becoming aware of any such legal infringements, we will remove the links concerned without delay.
